## ⚠️ JVM Issue Encountered
Neo4j is experiencing a JVM initialization error with Eclipse Collections:
```
Could not initialize class org.eclipse.collections.api.factory.primitive.LongSets
```

This prevents creating additional nodes (Topics, Sources) via command line but doesn't affect the existing Framework structure.

## 🔧 Neo4j Browser Access

### Your Neo4j Configuration:
- **Bolt Port**: 7687 ✅ (Working)
- **HTTP Port**: Not accessible on 7475
- **Credentials**: neo4j:ptolemies ✅

### Accessing Neo4j Browser:
1. **Check Neo4j Desktop**: Open Neo4j Desktop application
2. **Find Browser URL**: In your "devqai" project, look for the browser URL
3. **Common URLs to try**:
   - http://localhost:7474 (standard)
   - http://localhost:7475 (configured)
   - Check your Neo4j Desktop for the exact URL

## 🎯 Complete the Import in Neo4j Browser

Once you access Neo4j Browser, copy and paste these commands:

### 1. Verify Current State
```cypher
MATCH (n) RETURN labels(n)[0] as NodeType, COUNT(n) as Count ORDER BY Count DESC;
```
Should show: Framework, 17

### 2. Create Topics (17 nodes)
```cypher
MERGE (api:Topic {name: "API", category: "concept"})
MERGE (auth:Topic {name: "authentication", category: "concept"})
MERGE (db:Topic {name: "database", category: "concept"})
MERGE (ui:Topic {name: "user interface", category: "concept"})
MERGE (testing:Topic {name: "testing", category: "concept"})
MERGE (deployment:Topic {name: "deployment", category: "concept"})

MERGE (monitoring:Topic {name: "monitoring", category: "concept"})
MERGE (animation:Topic {name: "animation", category: "concept"})
MERGE (frontend:Topic {name: "frontend", category: "concept"})
MERGE (backend:Topic {name: "backend", category: "concept"})
MERGE (python:Topic {name: "Python", category: "language"})
MERGE (javascript:Topic {name: "JavaScript", category: "language"})
MERGE (typescript:Topic {name: "TypeScript", category: "language"})
MERGE (css:Topic {name: "CSS", category: "language"})
MERGE (rust:Topic {name: "Rust", category: "language"})
RETURN "Topics created" as status;
```

### 3. Create Sources (17 nodes)
```cypher
MERGE (s1:Source {name: "FastAPI", chunk_count: 8, avg_quality: 0.800, priority: "low", description: "FastAPI documentation source"})
MERGE (s2:Source {name: "NextJS", chunk_count: 5, avg_quality: 0.780, priority: "low", description: "NextJS documentation source"})
MERGE (s3:Source {name: "SurrealDB", chunk_count: 21, avg_quality: 0.967, priority: "medium", description: "SurrealDB documentation source"})
MERGE (s4:Source {name: "Tailwind", chunk_count: 23, avg_quality: 0.870, priority: "medium", description: "Tailwind documentation source"})
MERGE (s5:Source {name: "Shadcn", chunk_count: 22, avg_quality: 0.864, priority: "medium", description: "Shadcn documentation source"})
MERGE (s6:Source {name: "Pydantic AI", chunk_count: 9, avg_quality: 0.978, priority: "low", description: "Pydantic AI documentation source"})

RETURN "Sources created" as status;
```

### 4. Create Relationships
```cypher
// Source-Framework relationships
MATCH (s:Source {name: "FastAPI"}), (f:Framework {name: "FastAPI"})
MERGE (s)-[r:DOCUMENTS]->(f) SET r.coverage = "minimal";

MATCH (s:Source {name: "PyGAD"}), (f:Framework {name: "PyGAD"})
MERGE (s)-[r:DOCUMENTS]->(f) SET r.coverage = "complete";

MATCH (s:Source {name: "SurrealDB"}), (f:Framework {name: "SurrealDB"})
MERGE (s)-[r:DOCUMENTS]->(f) SET r.coverage = "partial";

// Framework integrations
MATCH (f1:Framework {name: "FastAPI"}), (f2:Framework {name: "Pydantic AI"})
MERGE (f1)-[r:INTEGRATES_WITH]->(f2) SET r.integration_type = "native";

MATCH (f1:Framework {name: "NextJS"}), (f2:Framework {name: "Tailwind CSS"})
MERGE (f1)-[r:INTEGRATES_WITH]->(f2) SET r.integration_type = "native";

// Topic relationships
MATCH (t1:Topic {name: "API"}), (t2:Topic {name: "authentication"})
MERGE (t1)-[r:RELATED_TO]->(t2) SET r.relationship_type = "sibling";

RETURN "Relationships created" as status;
```

### 5. Final Verification
```cypher
MATCH (n) RETURN labels(n)[0] as NodeType, COUNT(n) as Count ORDER BY Count DESC;
```
Should show:
- Framework: 17
- Topic: 17  
- Source: 17
